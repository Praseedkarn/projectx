Amritsar is more than just a city — it is an emotion.

Start your day early at the Golden Temple, where silence and devotion fill the air.

After langar, walk through the old lanes and taste Amritsari kulcha, lassi, and chole.

End your evening at Wagah Border witnessing patriotism at its peak.

Darjeeling is best explored slowly.

Wake up early for Tiger Hill sunrise, then sip tea overlooking misty hills.

Avoid rushing — walk, sit, and let the mountains speak.

Sometimes, doing nothing is the best itinerary.
