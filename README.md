## 🧠 How AI Works

1. **User Input**
   - User selects destination, duration, group type, and preferences.

2. **Prompt Builder**
   - Inputs are converted into strict, rule-based prompts  
   - Different prompts for **Hourly / One-Day / Multi-Day** trips.

3. **AI Generation**
   - Requests are sent to **Groq (LLaMA 3.1)** with controlled tokens and temperature.
   - AI is forced to follow a fixed format (no randomness).

4. **Structured Parsing**
   - AI text is converted into clean JSON.
   - Invalid or broken responses are rejected automatically.

5. **Fallback Safety**
   - City info → Wikipedia first  
   - If Wiki fails → AI generates reliable backup content.

6. **Final Output**
   - Data is rendered into timelines, cards, sliders, and calendars.
   - Result is editable, exportable, and mobile-friendly.
